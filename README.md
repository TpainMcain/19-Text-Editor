## Description
J.A.T.E. (Just Another Text Editor), is a web-based editor designed for creating notes and code snippets. It operates reliably regardless of internet connectivity, thanks to the implementation of service workers and Cache API's. Its offline-first architecture allows users to access previously visited pages without the need for an internet connection, providing a consistent user experience and facilitating uninterrupted workflow.
